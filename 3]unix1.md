## üß† Pro Tip for Support Teams:

Create aliases for frequent `ls` uses in `.bashrc`:

```bash
alias ll='ls -lh'
alias ltr='ls -ltr'
alias lt='ls -lt'
alias la='ls -la'
```

Then reload:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```



### file start with :
- i.e dash = it means file   d = it means directory   l = means link


### Every Linux system have three types of owner:
   - User: A user is the one who created the file. By default, whosoever, creates the file becomes the owner of the file. A user can create, delete, or modify the file.
   - Group: A group can contain multiple users. All the users belonging to a group have same access permission for a file.
   - Other: Any one who has access to the file other than user and group comes in the category of other. Other has neither created the file nor is a group member.

### Users and groups can be locally managed in /etc/psswd or /etc/group.

r-read       w-write        x-execute

Each permission (r, w, x) has a corresponding octal value: r = 4, w = 2, and x = 1.
